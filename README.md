Project: Calculator for Odin Project

Thoroughly enjoyed this project as I took a careful approach on how to apply/learn HTML concepts. I tried to break down ideas I had in order to fulfill the criteria listed on the project page and researched them vs using AI to solve the problems. There were one or two parts I did struggle with that I had no idea how to resolve and resorted to using AI to help get through it. 

Overall I think I learned alot on how to build more onto my previous HTML knowledge and revisiting HTML + CSS structures. While my project wasn't as concise as it could have been, I was more so proud I didn't give up and continued attempting to solve the problems.
